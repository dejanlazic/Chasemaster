* WSDL file is taken manually from web browser (TODO: Check why Maven plugin isn't working properly)

ws.client package
=========


* Client classes are generated by CXF using WSDL

* Because generated SOAP stack classes (used by web appliaction client to communicate with web service) are in the same WAR file as manually created SOAP files on the service side (ws.data package), I had to specify different namespace in all XML types in ws.client package. For example:
@XmlType(name = "abstractEntity", namespace="client")

* TODO: Split *.web and *.ws packages in 2 separate WAR files, including ws.client in *.web

com.mgs.chess package
=============

* I implemented ChessAnalyzer.isCheckMate() because it was not implemented
