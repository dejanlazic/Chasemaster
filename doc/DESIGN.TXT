Layers:

* Web
 - MVC
 - Ajax

* Service

* DB persistence: JDBC, prepared statements, DAO design pattern

---

* Because all clients must wait until the last one sends his movement (to be able to choose winning movement before returning response to clients), I'll have to implement either stateful WS (EJB or Spring?) (preferred) or asynchronous WS + reading response from file/MOM (queue).
- see Journal #5 for details about Asynchronous Ajax details (instead of WS)
